        <h2>Author's Note</h2>

        <p>
            The Equity Adaptive Framework (EAF) was conceived in 2025 by a first-year computer science student navigating a landscape shaped by systemic inequities and personal challenges. Having experienced bad faith and willful negligence in both the final year of high school and in part-time work, and living as a second-generation immigrant, an ethnic minority, and a neurodivergent individual, I recognized firsthand how structures designed to protect often fail those most vulnerable.
        </p>

        <p>
           Rather than letting these experiences consume me, EAF became a way to channel that understanding into action—transforming frustration into a structured framework capable of evaluating fairness, accountability, and ethical responsibility across legal, corporate, digital, consumer, and social domains. Being in a new environment away from home allowed for clarity and focus, fostering the development of principles that are both robust and contextually adaptive.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2026, this vision took tangible form with the launch of the EAF website, providing a public platform for accessible, human-centered guidance on ethical evaluation and systemic reform. EAF is not merely a response to past inequities; it is a forward-looking tool designed to protect good-faith actors, expose negligence or malfeasance, and ensure fairness is consistently applied—regardless of power, status, or circumstance.
        </p>

        <p>Through EAF, I aim to codify fairness not as an abstract ideal but as a practical, actionable system—ensuring that equity is not reserved for the privileged, but available to all.</p>
